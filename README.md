- 👋 Hi, I’m Robbie, aka Aztl
- 🌏 I am the owner and lead developer of [Avatarverse](https://github.com/Avatarverse), a Minecraft RPG server that has recreated the world of *Avatar: The Last Airbender*
- 🔥 I'm also working on [Avatarversalis](https://github.com/Avatarverse/Avatarversalis), a new bending plugin
- 🐲 My future goals include endeavoring into other franchises like *A Song of Ice and Fire* and recreating those worlds and RPG systems in Minecraft as well.
- ⚙️ Eventually, I'd like to create my own game engine so I can lead the development of entirely new RPG games based on my favorite fictional universes.
- 👑 After that, I'll create a game for a universe of my own creation, replete with entirely new languages, cultures, music, nations, history, etc.
- 😇 But for now I'm just focusing on Avatarverse.
- 🌱 I currently know Java, Python, R, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.
- 💞️ If any of the above interests you, please reach out! I'd be happy to bring you onto my team.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is by messaging me on Discord: `@aztl`
